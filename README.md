# Data-Science-Intern
Data Science Internship  Updated in 16 seconds Completed assigned data science projects as an intern with Hash Analytics Global Data Analytics Internship.  I was given the opportunity to apply my skills in programming with Python to solve real world data analysis problems. I learned how to program several Python libraries for data analysis including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Sea born etc. I also developed the useful skill of applying Machine Learning to gain useful insights from data, as well as visualizing data with Tableau, monitoring web traffic using Google Analytics, and wrangling data in Ms Excel.  Essentially, I gained important soft skills such as productivity and meeting tight deadlines on the job.
